## Properties of Haskell

Haskell is a [[The Functional Programming Paradigm|Purely Functional]] language with:

1. Strong Static Typing
	- Data types are strictly enforced at compile time.
2. Type Inference
	- The compiler can automatically deduce data types based on usage and context, but they must still be statically typed.
3. Lazy Evaluation
	- Data is only computed when necessary, more on this later.

## The Type System

Before we look at any Haskell code, I think it would be beneficial to first understand [[The Basic Data Types of Haskell]].

Now that you know the difference between an `Int`, `Integer` and `[Int]`, we should probably talk about how types are grouped together into [[The Basic Type Classes of Haskell|Type Classes]].

## Getting Started with Haskell

Everyone knows Python, right?

Let's take a very simple Python script and work towards recreating it in Haskell.

```Python
def add_then_mult(a, b):
	return (a+b) * a * b

def main():
	result = add_then_mult(4, 5)
	print(result)
```

We're passing in two numbers, $a=4$ and $b=5$ then returning their sum $a+b$, multiplied by $a \times b$. We then print the result to the screen.

> [!NOTE]
> The first thing you'll need to do is install GHCup. To do so, go to https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/ and run the installer. Note that some steps may take like 10 minutes.

To recreate the function body, we use some [[Simple Haskell Expressions]] and find out *it's exactly the same*.

```Haskell
(a + b) * a * b
```

So this would work... except it needs a function to live in. So why don't we look at the [[Function Basics in Haskell]].

With that, we can create our function `add_then_mult`.

```Haskell
add_then_mult :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a
add_then_mult a b = (a + b) * a * b
```

And we can call the function with our inputs $a=4$ and $b=5$:

```Haskell
add_then_mult 4 5
-- 180
```

We now just need to print it to the screen, and to do so we can use the `print` function inside a `main` function.

```Haskell
add_then_mult :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a
add_then_mult a b = (a + b) * a * b

main = print $ add_then_mult 4 5
```

And if we use the [[GHCi#Main Command|Main Command]] in GHCi to execute `main`, we will see the result:

```Haskell
:main
180
```

Or, if you want to be fancy, you can put this script into a file like `main.hs` and run `ghc main.hs` on it. This will compile your program into a binary like `main.exe` which you can then execute in the terminal.

Yippee, you have just created your first executable Haskell program!

## A Word About Curry

Haskell utilises [[Currying in Haskell|Currying]] to create some interesting emergent behaviour.

---

## More Haskell Types

Probably the most important type in Haskell is the [[Lists in Haskell|List]], there are many more of what are known as [[Type Constructors In Haskell|Type Constructors]].

---

## Pattern Matching

We're now getting towards some of the powerful stuff, **Polymorphism**, via [[Pattern Matching In Haskell|Pattern Matching]].

And a useful tool for this is [[Case Expressions|Case Expressions in Haskell]].
