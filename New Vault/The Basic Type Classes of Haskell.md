## Classes in Haskell

> [!danger] Potential Misconception about Haskell Classes
> Note that the definition of a class in Haskell is not the same as in [[Object Orientated Programming]].
> 
> In Haskell, a class is much more similar to [[Interfaces in Java]].

> [!Important] Definition of a Type Class
> In Haskell, a type class is a generic interface which specifies a set of functions which any type must implement in order to be an instance of the type class.

Put in simpler terms: 

1. A type class will have methods associated with it.
2. All types which are instances of the type class must provide some implementation of each function.
3. It creates a sort of contract, saying that "Any type which is an instance of this class will support these methods". (This is where the similarity to OOP interfaces comes from.)

Type classes can also depend on one another, requiring a type to already be a member of a different typeclass before it can be a member of that one. Remember that being a member just means implementing certain methods.

Type classes can provide default implementations of methods but these can be overwritten by the implementor.

## Class Constraints

### The Problem

I told you before that the type signature of the `(+)` function was this:

```Haskell
(+) :: Int -> Int -> Int
```

Making `3 + 7 = 10`, all good. But what if we want to do `3.2 + 7.8`?

Well, we could define `(+)` with Float instead.

```Haskell
(+) :: Float -> Float -> Float
```

Now we can do `3.2 + 7.8 = 11.0`, yippee!

But now `3 + 7 = 10.0`. A float, cringe.

There must be a better way...

### The Solution

Near the end of the section on basic data types, we discussed [[The Basic Data Types of Haskell#Type Variables|Type Variables]]. A method in Haskell to make functions polymorphic.

We could rewrite the `(+)` function using a type variable!

```Haskell
(+) :: a -> a -> a
```

Now it says that if you input two of the same type, you'll get that same type back out.

And we get:

```Haskell
3 + 7 -- 10
3.0 + 7.0 -- 10.0
```

But as it stands, there's nothing stopping us from putting a `Char` or a `(Int, [Bool])` into the function, which makes no sense. The `(+)` operator only works on numbers.

If only we could apply some sort of constraint on the type variable, to only allow items of a certain typeclassâ€¦

Say we had a typeclass called `Num` which represented integer and floating point numbers. Well, that's exactly what we want to allow into our `(+)` function!

You apply a class constraint with the `=>` operator.

```Haskell
(+) :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a
```

This says, "You can put a variable of any type into this function, as long as that variable's type is an instance of `Num`".

> [!important] This is a Class Constraint!

You can also add multiple class constraints if you wish:

```Haskell
someFunction :: (Num a, Ord b) => a -> b
```

## The Basic Type Classes of Haskell

Haskell implements 9 basic type classes, although there are many more.

1. `Eq`
2. `Ord`
3. `Num`
4. `Integral`
5. `Floating`
6. `Bounded`
7. `Show`
8. `Read`
9. `Enum`

> [!note]
> Don't worry about the exact syntax in the examples, you'll learn that next. It's there so you can get more context once you understand the syntax.

### Eq

The `Eq` typeclass provides an interface for testing equality. Any member of the `Eq` typeclass implements `==` and `/=` (Haskell uses /= for inequality).

### Ord

The `Ord` typeclass provides an interface for testing the order of items. Any member of `Ord` implements `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

Because it needs `>=` and `<=`, any type which is an instance of `Ord` must already be an instance of `Eq`.

### Num

`Num` members behave like numbers. All number types are members of `Num`, including `Int`, `Integer`, `Float` and `Double`.

`Num` implements the functions `(+)`, `(-)`, `(*)` as well as some others.

In fact, I lied in the last section about data types. Get rekt. I said that the type of `20` was `Int`:

```Haskell
20 :: Int
```

But actually, it's not, it's a `Num`.

```Haskell
20 :: (Num t) => t
```

> [!warning] Additional context
> In fact, this makes numbers a kind of "Polymorphic Constant".
> 
> - If you put `20` into a function expecting an `Int`, then it will become an `Int`.
> - If you put `20` into a function expecting a `Float`, then it will become a `Float`.
> 
> This is what is happening when we do `20 :: Int` vs `20 :: Float`. In other languages, this is all handled automatically, but in Haskell it happens as a consequence of the type system.
> 
> This is also how the `minBound` and `maxBound` constants work. The constants take different values based on their type.

### Integral 

The `Integral` class represents whole numbers: `Int` and `Integer`.

`Integral` implements a few functions like `quot`, `rem`, `div`, `mod`. So just a bunch of integer division functions.

A useful function for dealing with numbers is `fromIntegral`.

```Haskell
fromIntegral :: (Num b, Integral a) => a -> b
```

It takes an `Integral` and turns it into the more general `Num`. This is useful for mixing `Int` and `Float`.

> [!example]
> Take the `length` function of type `length :: [a] -> Int`. If we tried to get the length of a list and add it to a `Num` type, we would get a type error.
> 
> The addition function `(+)` expects two values which are instances of `Num`. But `length` is implemented badly and so it returns an `Int`.
> 
> We can use `fromIntegral` to convert this `Int` into a `Num` so it's more useful.
> 
> ```Haskell
> 10 + length [1, 2, 3, 4]
> -- 14
> 
> 10.0 + length [1, 2, 3, 4]
> -- * No instance for (Fractional Int) arising from the literal `10.0'
> 
> 10.0 + fromIntegral (length [1, 2, 3, 4])
> -- 14.0
> ```
> 
> Yippee.

### Floating

The `Floating` class represents floating point numbers, `Float` and `Double`.

`Floating` implements a bunch of mathematical functions like `pi`, `exp`, `log`, `sqrt`, `(**)`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan` and loads more.

### Bounded

The `Bounded` class represents types which have an explicit minimum and maximum bound.

It implements the constants (really they're functions with no arguments) `minBound` and `maxBound` that we saw earlier.

```Haskell
minBound :: Int
-- -9223372036854775808

maxBound :: Char
-- '\1114111'

maxBound :: Bool
-- True

minBound :: Bool
-- False
```

This also makes them polymorphic constants, with a type signature of `(Bounded a) => a`.

### Show

The `Show` typeclass provides an interface for converting values to strings with its `show` function.

`show` takes an input of type `Show` and converts it to a string.

```Haskell
show 10
-- "10"

show [10, 20, 30]
-- "[10,20,30]"
```

### Read

The `Read` typeclass provides an interface for converting strings to values.

The function `read` takes a string input and converts it to a `Read`.

> [!Warning] Ambiguous Types
> Take this code using the `read` function.
> 
> ```Haskell
> read "4"
> ```
> 
> Trying this gives you an error.
> 
> ```
> Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
> 	  `Read a' arising from a use of `read' at \<interactive>:1:0-7
> 	  Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
>  ```
 > `read` returns a value in the `Read` typeclass, but it can't infer what type the result is. It could be an `Int`, a `Float`, a `List`, anything!
> 
> Remember, a type class is just an interface, it's not a type itself. A value cannot be of type `Read`, it can only be a type which is a member of `Read`.
> 
> We can fix this with a type annotation.
> 
> ```Haskell
> read "4" :: Int
> -- 4
> 
> read "4" :: Float
> -- 4.0
> ```

### Enum

`Enum` members are sequentially ordered types, they can be enumerated.

The best part about `Enum` members is that they can be used in list ranges.

The types in `Enum` will implement the successor `succ` and predecessor `pred` functions.

`Bool`, `Char`, `Ord`, `Int`, `Integer`, `Float` and `Double` are all in this class.

```Haskell
['a'..'e'] -- "abcde"

[LT .. GT] -- [LT,EQ,GT]

[3..7] -- [3,4,5,6,7]

succ 'B' -- 'C'
pred 4 -- 3
```
